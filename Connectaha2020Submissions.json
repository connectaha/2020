    "description": "One main goal of great user experience is creating digital products that ANYONE can use. If you are not thinking about accessibility, then you’re not thinking about the full user experience. Ideally, the user experience for everyone should be the same regardless of physical or cognitive limitations. This means addressing user accessibility scenarios from the onset. Accessibility makes it possible for people with disabilities to understand and navigate well designed digital products. However, accessibility is often one of the last things addressed in product and software design. These guidelines will cover some of the major factors to address and test for in order to meet the accessibility standards in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). ",

    "description": "Originating as a C# developer, the benefits of functional programming always taunted me. Yet, most applications I worked on heavily relied on user interfaces and an otherwise object-oriented architecture, so the decision to move to F# or some other functional programming language didn't make sense. \r\n\r\nDespite this, many principles and patterns from functional programming DID make sense to implement for cleaner and more robust code. Important paradigms like immutability, method chaining, and using expressions over statements were certainly things even C# developers could take advantage of! In this talk, I want to demonstrate how C# developers can implement these beneficial patterns and principles and explore how doing so ultimately results in better code!\r\n\r\n",

When trying to solve a problem, thinking through the solution step by step in a procedural way can be quite useful. However when the problem grows more complex, so can the body of the ‘for each’ loop. It’s at this point it becomes advantageous to move toward a more declarative style of programming.

As a disabled person, I advocate heavily for listening to people with disabilities about our needs, and moving beyond thinking of accessibility as something we \"have to do\" and towards an ethical responsibility we should be excited to do. I've given talks across the US to a wide variety of audiences, led workshops, participated on panels, and appeared on podcasts; I'd love to share my knowledge with your audience!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn outline for this talk: (Please note that a11y is an abbreviation for accessibility; PwD is an abbreviation for people with disabilities.)\r\n\r\nIntro\r\n- what's the point of this talk?\r\n- who am i, and why should you be listening to me?\r\n- who are you? raise your hand if you've heard about a11y before, raise your hand if you've built something with a11y in mind\r\n\r\nthe basics\r\n- what is a11y\r\n- the basics of legal compliance - the ADA and section 508\r\n- more guidelines outside of the US\r\n- the WCAG\r\n\r\nlegal compliance\r\n- so many companies ask \"are we wcag compliant\" or \"is the website ada\"\r\n- so often, clients are concerned with following the law, doing the bare minimum. and as consultants, we sell ourselves as being able to do the bare minimum, aka compliance\r\n- those of us that work on internal code, we often just care about hitting the WCAG as a testing criteria\r\n- even as individuals, we often sell ourselves to companies we want to work for as \"well i know the wcag\"\r\n- and this makes sense, when you think about the developer mindset, right? we write a test, we seek to pass it. and the wcag is a testable thing!\r\n- we're motivated by not getting sued, or being legally allowed to launch, if we're a gov't entity\r\n\r\nbeyond\r\n- WCAG AA is a minimum passing grade. it's like getting a D. good job, i guess?\r\n- it doesn't feel warm and fuzzy to just like, meet minimum requirements to pass a minimum bar\r\n- accessibility is about inclusion. thinking of it from a legal perspective ignores WHY the laws exist!\r\n- history time! let's talk about the rehab act and the ADA, and the people who fought hard for those.\r\n- the WCAG doesn't exist because some benevolent privileged abled people decided to be nice to those of us with disabilities. it exists because we fight for it, because we push for it.\r\n\r\nhow to build empathy\r\n- DON'T do disability simulations\r\n- hire people with disabilities\r\n- do user interviews with PwD\r\n- do user testing and validation with PwD\r\n- learn about WHY a11y guidelines are the way they are\r\n- follow disability rights activists - i've got twitter and youtube suggestions\r\n- read a book!\r\n\r\nbut empathy doesn't pay the bills\r\n- it's hard to sell bosses and the business interests on empathy and inclusion. (unless you work somewhere awesome (like i do)). you also need to provide the financial motivations for a11y\r\n- PwD control $$$ of discretionary income\r\n- PwD prefer services that are accessible and will choose those\r\n- not getting sued is a great way to save money!\r\n- it's WAY CHEAPER to bake a11y in than add it later\r\n\r\nif not you, who",

Writing the tests first is part of test driven development, but only one part. And some would argue not the most important part.\r\n \r\nIn this session we’ll talk about what test driven development (TDD) actually is and how it differs from other types of testing. We’ll go over the basic mechanics of TDD. Then we’ll write some code using TDD, both to show these mechanics and to illustrate how using TDD can not only add tests but result in better code than we might otherwise end up with.\r\n \r\nIf you’ve never done TDD before or have done a little and would like to learn more, this session is for you.",

These two practices can be a great tool in developing software, but I’ve found that not a lot of developers get an opportunity to practice them.

    "description": "A good case can be made for why boring is preferable to exciting in many aspects of our lives. Yet, we're reluctant to apply this sentiment to the web. Rather, we're in a relentless pursuit of the exciting in this increasingly JavaScript-centric world of web development. A pursuit that, despite our best efforts, litters the landscape of the web with excruciatingly slow and inaccessible pages. As division brews over the roles of HTML, CSS, and indeed JavaScript itself, we need to ask if it's worth making the web boring again.\r\n\r\nBut why make the web more boring? Because boring is fast, resilient, fault tolerant, and accessible. Boring is the essence of unobtrusive designs that facilitate interactions rather than hinder them. When we rely wholesale on JavaScript to build for the web, we're inevitably reinventing things—things that can hinder or even fail people in unexpected ways despite our best intentions. In this session, you'll learn why building for the web with a greater emphasis on core technologies is far from boring, but truly rewarding and exciting work that makes the web more inclusive.",

From mentoring to open source to tutoring to just showing up, there are numerous ways folks with tech or tech-adjacent skills can make a difference in their communities. \r\n\r\n**Format**\r\n\r\nThough some of the material is more pertinent to programmers, this talk applies to anyone who works in tech. I start with looking at why tech folks might want to get involved their community (ie: benefits such as business leads, learning new skills, building up your resume, etc.), then I look at the different hows of volunteering (ie: mentoring, speaking, tutoring, coding, etc.)\r\n\r\nI conclude with a section about how to find where to volunteer, highlighting various national organizations and nonprofits, and then exploring methods for finding locally-oriented opportunities in attendees' own communities. There's also time for Q\u0026A at the end. Throughout, I include examples from my own life to demonstrate the wide variety of opportunities available, showing that even accounting for attendees' individual time constraints, interests, and abilities, there's something for everyone.",

    "title": "I'm Not Just Tired: Understanding Burnout",
    "abstract": "Confused about burnout? Yeah, me too. I recently had an experience with it, but even I wasn't even sure if I'd actually had it or was just telling myself I had. This talk is intended to bring some clarity about the topic for people in the software world.",
    "description": "“Burnout” is one of the most confusing and loaded words in modern business. News articles shout that it’s on the rise, but the shifting definitions, the varied personal anecdotes, and its unclear medical status can leave you confused. Are you dealing with burnout? How do you know? If you are, what do you do about it? How do you talk with anyone else about it?\r\n\r\nCome and get a glimpse beneath the surface of this phenomenon in this talk based on both psychological studies and personal experiences. You’ll learn the answers to the questions above... but you’ll also learn what sorts of situations lead to burnout, how it can intertwine with other mental challenges including trauma, and why fixing it isn’t just as simple as taking time off work. Most importantly, you’ll learn things you can start doing tomorrow to recover from burnout, and how you can help prevent it - both as a manager, and simply for yourself. ",
    "notes": "This talk is all about clarification and description of what burnout actually is, what we can do about it, and how we can prevent it. I'll use my trademark blend of research, experience, and humor to give people a well-rounded knowledge of the different things we call burnout and give them something they can take away and use.",

    "abstract": "Our AI/ML doesn't do us any good if it's just doing the exact same thing as humans, except faster. Our artificial brains need to be BETTER than us - if we can create a fairer, better world, why not do it? Let's beware our assumptions and analyze our training data better before we even start!",
    "description": "In the glorious AI-assisted future, all decisions are objective and perfect, and there’s no such thing as biases. That’s why we created AI and machine learning, right? Because humans can make mistakes, and computers are perfect. Well, there’s some bad news: humans make those AIs and machine learning models, and as a result humanity’s biases and missteps can subtly work their way into our AI and models.\r\n\r\nAll hope isn’t lost, though! In this talk you’ll learn how science and statistics have already solved some of these problems and how a robust awareness of cognitive biases can help with many of the rest. Come learn what else we can do to protect ourselves from these old mistakes, because we owe it to the people who’ll rely on our algorithms to deliver the best possible intelligence!",

    "description": "The alluring world of open-source is incontestably attracting budding developers to contribute \u0026 enrich this sphere, but unfortunately there seems to be a highly skewed sex-ratio which is perturbing nonetheless. According to a recent survey by Github, only 4% of open-source participants, developers and ideators are women and/or non-binary. The percentage of female users tends to decrease as the number of contributions \u0026 repositories recorded go up and user activity increases. This disconcerting disparity can - and should - definitely be blotted out.\r\n\r\nThis might be due to the fact that women especially find it intimidating to get started with contributing to open source. The speaker wishes to back them up solidly by answering questions, throwing light on the issues that they usually have. It aims at introducing the audience to the world of FOSS and elaborate the vast range of opportunities ranging from coding to documentation, design, outreach and research. The speaker shall converse her involvements and experiences in Open Source with a handful of organisations and its impact on her tech crusade so far. A special emphasis shall be on the dearth of women in technology. It aspires to inspire budding girl developers and showcase women who’ve made significant contributions to technology.\r\n\r\nThis talk targets females, other underrepresented groups and supportive men, open source enthusiasts/ developers in university and colleges, to-be graduates, and/or recent graduates, academicians and thought leaders. The main agenda of the talk is to view the open source world beyond the perspective of coding. It also aims to encourage fellow female to dive into developing and discuss the vast range of opportunities available.\r\n\r\nThe speaker is an ardent open source developer and a brown female who is putting her best to pave a way in this vast male-dominated world of technology. She has worked collaboratively with multi-national teams on global projects, mentored aspiring developers, delivered talks in conferences, conducted tech workshops and has also successfully completed many research assignments. With her enthusiasm, inquisitiveness and ever- pleasing personality, the speaker shall definitely add a personal touch to this talk and the audience shall be able to connect very well with the session presenter :)",

This talk reviews them all and helps you choose one for an efficient design solution !",
    "description": "The soaring popularity of Python and its assorted applications can be attributed to its simplicity and flexibility. In this talk, I will review the modern bloom \u0026 dominance of Python and discuss four major coding styles often used: Imperative, Procedural, Functional, and Object-Oriented. I will go over the fundamentals of each programming paradigm and discuss their positives, limitations and use cases especially in Python setting along-with a very simple hands-on example to illustrate how one routine can be coded in a different style. The talk will conclude with some pointers on how to choose a coding style for a given situation to make the code more readable, testable and coherent.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to introduce different programming styles of Python and encourage Pythonistas to reflect on the implications of each corresponding to their domain viz. data visualisation, machine learning, functional programming, or embedded systems, web development. By better understanding these styles attendees will be empowered to design efficient solutions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Outline of the proposed talk\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n- The rise of Python and its many applications: Reason for its bloom \u0026 dominance\r\n- Reflecting on the simplicity and flexibility providing comfort and independence\r\n\r\n###  Overview of programming styles with positives \u0026 limitations in each\r\n- `Imperative Programming`: Sequential, Direct change to program state, Data structure manipulation, Harder debugging, Limited abstraction, Complex semantics\r\n- `Procedural Programming`: Sequential, Iterative, Modularized, Tasks’ function calling, Inefficient hardware usage especially for complex problems\r\n- `Functional Programming`: Stateless functions, Immutable data, Independent of order of execution, More modularity, Useful for - Recursion, Lambda Functions, Parallel Processing\r\n- `Object-oriented Programming`: Object manipulation via methods only, Code reusability, Limited support by Python (currently)\r\n\r\n### One example coded in different programming styles for illustration\r\n- Task definition, say _average of a list of numbers_\r\n- Code in different styles: Imperative, Procedural, Functional, Object-oriented\r\n- Usage of lambda functions, class creation, method creation, etc.\r\n- Discussing speed, efficiency, reusability, simplicity of each style\r\n\r\n### Conclusion \u0026 Takeaways\r\n- Pointers on how to select a programming paradigm based on the application\r\n- Discussing pros and cons of combining, interleaving multiple styles\r\n- Some personal anecdotes, recommendations for different use cases",

    "abstract": "This talk is about how the CocoaPods project dealt with scaling demand while remaining free and open-source.",
    "description": "CocoaPods is a package manager for developers working on iOS, macOS and all other Apple-related platforms. CocoaPods is a free, open-source project maintained by volunteers and is completely run on free, sponsor-funded infrastructure. This places unique constraints on both its client and server architecture.\r\n\r\nThis talk is about how the CocoaPods project dealt with scaling demand while remaining free and open-source.\r\n\r\nSince its 1.0 release in 2016, CocoaPods has faced unique challenges of scale. CocoaPods made the news for hitting the hard envelope of git itself. GitHub was reportedly keeping 5 servers up just for CocoaPods registry cloning. Being free and public, user growth is not limited by any factor. To date, CocoaPods' users have published more than 300 thousand package versions. Usage is still growing, despite Apple announcing native SwiftPM support in Xcode.\r\n\r\nBeing volunteer-maintained and run on sponsor infrastructure, it must rely heavily on the \"free for open-source\" plans of various organizations. The main registry is managed through one of the largest and most challenging repositories on GitHub. The most common way to distribute the packages themselves is through GitHub repos. The project's websites are hosted on GitHub pages. The web search is done using Algolia. The CI/CD pipeline runs on both Travis CI and CircleCI.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, clone/update operations on the CocoaPods registry were slow and arduous. On CI pipelines, a clone operation would take more than 2 minutes each time. Something had to be done. This is the story of getting a Good+Free+Fast CDN for CocoaPods.",
    "notes": "### Scaling when free and open source\r\n\r\nCocoaPods is a free, open-source project run by maintainers in their spare time. As such, it depends on the good graces and sponsorships of multiple tech companies. The initial decision was to store the specs in a GitHub repo, a common practice for a free, open-source project for storing such metadata. \r\n\r\nThe first hurdles of scale were encountered in 2016, when traffic to the master spec repo has caused GitHub to [rate-limit all operations]({% post_url 2016-05-04-Master-Spec-Repo-Rate-Limiting-Post-Mortem %}).  \r\nA [comment from GitHub](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4989#issuecomment-193772935) at the time stated that this repo alone was using 5 whole server CPUs and consuming terabytes upon terabytes of bandwidth.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was averted by [sharding the repo]({% post_url 2016-10-28-Sharding %}) to improve algorithmic performance and by limiting all first-time clones to being shallow. \r\n\r\nThis has solved GitHub's problem, but CocoaPods' users still had to deal with unsatisfactory performance.\r\n\r\n### Git as a Database\r\n\r\nGit was invented at a time when \"slow network\" and \"no backups\" were legitimate design concerns. Running endless builds as part of continuous integration wasn't commonplace. CDN wasn't so commonly available.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories of git repos hitting the hard envelope of git's design constraints. [Microsoft's Windows repo](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/bharry/the-largest-git-repo-on-the-planet/) is one example. CocoaPods is another.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, the spec repo had:\r\n\r\n* almost 400k commits - half of the Linux Kernel repo!\r\n* over 400k directories\r\n* over 300k spec files\r\n\r\nThese numbers have caused the repo to take minutes to clone, long times to update and have wasted uncountable CI time. It has also proven to be resistant to tarballing, as this sort of directory structure hits a bottleneck in `tar` as well. \r\n\r\n### Directory Listing Denied\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to many that the spec repo should be put behind a CDN, but there were several constraints:\r\n\r\n1. It had to be a free CDN, as the project is free and open-source.\r\n2. It had to allow some way of obtaining directory listings, for retrieving versions of pods.\r\n3. It had to auto-update from GitHub as the source of truth.\r\n\r\n### Final Lap with Netlify\r\n\r\nThe [final version](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/pull/541) of the CDN for CocoaPods/Specs was implemented on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), a static site hosting service supporting flexible site generation. This solution ticked all the boxes: a generous open-source plan, fast CDN and continuous deployment from GitHub.",

    "description": "For almost two decades, the biggest decision was whether it was time to upgrade to the latest .NET framework or not.  Not there .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET Standard. So many options and it is not completely obviously which one (or ones) you should be using.  During this session we will review the different frameworks/standards and talk about where you should be using the different frameworks/standards.  Then we will focus on how you can easily support multiple platforms with .NET Standard and no compromises, thanks to multi-targeting.  We will also over the other aspects of building .NET Standard libraries such as versioning, strong naming, and binding redirects.",

I joined a Math-focused track in high-school in Iran that'd prepare me for a Computer Science major in University. I came to the US at the age 18 and attended ISU, knowing very little English. I was admitted to their CS program shortly after I started my BS. I spent long days and nights at the computer lab until I was finally able to buy my own laptop before my graduation.\r\n\r\nOver my fifteen year career as a software developer, I've served as a team lead in a Fortune 500 company, led teams globally as a consultant at ThoughtWorks, founded my own company, Tested Minds, lead a team at Morningstar to deliver CEO's highest priority project, and currently lead teams as a Principal Consultant at Tandem (madeintandem.com).

    "description": "We have a choice in designing our software development careers. We can follow the path of a technologist learning and exploiting one technology to solve the problems that particular technology was built to solve. Alternatively, we can be a computational thinker who can address a much broader set of problems, choosing or building the technology needed for the problem at hand. This second path is technology agnostic, and doesn’t even require a computer besides our own mind.\r\nIn this talk, we compare the human mind to a computer and discuss ways to build intuition for our code.\r\n\r\n- RubyFuza, Cape Town 2020: https://www.rubyfuza.org/\r\n\r\n- O'Reilly. Software Architecture Conference, San Jose 2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLirefOGvCU\r\n\r\n- SCNA 2017, with the focus of how early a human can start thinking computationally: http://sarahaslanifar.com/computer/science/2017/10/27/computational-thinking.html\r\n\r\nI gave this talk at SCNA 2018 and I was pleasantly surprised and happy with so many people come to me and asked variety of questions from their own experience, learning in general, or teaching their children. One professor even came to me and talked about how he is trying to make education and programing fun for his students. One student mentioned that's how he felt about learning programing language but hadn't really seen anybody talk about it before. Another student said, he was introduced to programing syntax first before learning to think computationally, and he's been struggling with learning how to program.\r\n\r\nIt was very heartwarming to see I was able to connect to so many people connected with my talk. I would love to spread the word around and encourage other engineers to first understand the basics of what computer science is about, to understand high quality, high performance, and production ready code.\r\n\r\nComputational thinking is NOT thinking in programming language syntax. I think the worst thing we could do to get someone interested in programming is to introduce them to syntaxes like Java, C, or Fortran on day one. Why would they want to bother learning these unfamiliar, arcane details like pointers, classes, and compilation? Rather, let's start with a goal. What problem are they trying to solve? Can this problem be framed as a computational one that a computer can do much faster than we could?\r\n",
    "notes": "This talk would be tailored to the audience. For non-technical audience, I will focus more on theory of computation and why computers are important and for  technical audience, I tailor the talk to have more programing examples. \r\nIn this talk, we compare the human mind to a computer, which is more efficient in what scenarios?  Then, discuss ways to build intuition for our code. Rather than discuss “Big O” notation, I’ll include examples to build intuition about how our choice of data structures and algorithms impacts application performance. Last but not the least, I will wrap up with backed-up by research tips on how to work on our deep learning!",

With this foundation, I also want to deep-dive and examine how commonly used commands (like git reset, git checkout, git merge and git rebase, among many others) can be understood in terms of what has already been covered in the talk.",
    "notes": "As someone who has taught Git to over a hundred people in different roles (ranging from high school students to data analysts to designers to software developers), I've come across some things in Git that are commonly misunderstood by the people using it. In this talk I'll go through what I believe the key foundational concepts are that everyone should understand, and how a solid grasp of these concepts enable the user to make sense of the most common Git commands. Ultimately, this will provide a starting point for the user to further explore Git and use it without fear.",

That is not enough for someone who actually needs to implement it or evaluate its security. The general structure of the talk is:\r\n\r\nI've been a developer for over 13 years now, on application and vendor sides.

This driver gives us the power to automate tasks for the browser natively — just as a user would — allowing us to interact with and extract the elements of the browser. To achieve this goal it is necessary to do a little bit of scraping on the websites, but this is where the fun really begins. I will teach some tricks on how we can complete the same task through different ways, or different tasks through the same way. \r\n \r\nWith Tkinter, we will learn how to make a simple and easy interface for our python script, making it more dynamic and general so we can use it without changing too much code.",

    "title": "Building a Community for Development of Open Source Genomics Platform",
    "abstract": "Genomics is rapidly becoming routine in our everyday life. Processing of genomic data requires more computational resources than any other task which an ordinary person is likely to come across. We are building a community to create the first community-built open-source genomic analysis platform.",
    "description": "Introduction\r\n===========\r\n\r\nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is rapidly becoming routine in clinical practice and in everyday life. Processing and interpretation of genomic data requires more computational power and storage than any other task which an ordinary person is likely to come across in their life. Hence, one can assume, it should lead to a massive software development effort. The fact is that today, most genomics platforms are either proprietary or academically developed and maintained. Being proponents of open source, we have started building a community of clinicians, researchers and professional software developers from different countries and backgrounds to create the first community-built and fully open-source genomic analysis software platform - Forome (as a Forum for Omics).  \r\n\r\nTwo important goals of Forome Genomics Platform are to support both clinical and research workflows for all flavors of genetic data and to build into the platform integrated development environment for clinical rules, providing the ability to seamlessly transform research workflows into clinical guidelines, thus speeding up the adoption of WGS into clinical practice.\r\n\r\nPlatform\r\n========\r\n\r\nForome platform consists of the following major modules:\r\n\r\n* Upstream pipeline, that ingests data from a sequencing lab and creates the aligned BAM files as well as calls common variants using standard GATK haplotype callers.\r\n* A set of custom rare variant callers identifies extremely rare and unknown variants in a pedigree-aware way. \r\n* The downstream annotation pipeline injects a wide range of information related to functional analysis, population genetics, clinical knowledge, epigenetics, etc. \r\n* Anfisa - is a user interface for variant filtration, curation and interpretation\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view, Forome Anfisa is based on realization that genetic analysis belongs to the same class of analytical problems as data warehousing and business intelligence, where relatively static data is processed by application of OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP). Traditional Database Management Systems (DBMS) balance efficient modification of data with fast access, while OLAP tools specifically focus on achieving the maximum performance for data querying and information retrieval. OLAP approach is proven with other verticals like financial analysis, sales forecasting etc., but to the best of our knowledge has never been applied to the big data in genetics. \r\n\r\nAn ETL pipeline (known as annotation pipeline to bioinformatics folks) annotates genome of the patient and their family members with the data consolidated from various public and commercial databases (provided the end user has a license to specific data). For every case it creates an OLAP cube that serves as the backend for the analysis. The modular pipeline is designed to easily plug in third-party annotation tools and functional predictors, selected or, even created, by the users. (It makes it easier that the majority of the community tools are command line Linux programs.) A typical case consists of 6 to 7 million of records (called variants), with each record having from 300 to 2000 data entries (annotations).   \r\n\r\nFrom a functional perspective, filtration of variants is executed either by combining conventional conditions based on variant annotations (as in most existing variant filtration tools) or by building a decision tree that classifies the variants into several buckets. A typical decision tree consists of about 15 branching points, each point representing a complex condition on functional, clinical, sequencing quality, call quality and/or population genetics data. A rule represented as a decision tree is transparent and replicatablable, and when expressed in a scripting language can be easily included in any protocol.\r\n\r\nAnfisa’s interface is designed for a researcher or clinician to easily view and inspect the variants at each of the branching nodes and review which variants have been put into which bucket. This way a user, who is developing a new rule can easily see their mistakes or inefficiencies and improve and optimize the rule. Application of a rule to a whole genome (about 6 million variants) typically takes about one minute and produces a set of between a couple to a few hundred variants.  The variants that are eventually put in the bucket “for further manual review” then presented to a clinical geneticist for interpretation. Anfisa includes hundreds of data points about each variant as well as links to publicly available databases for information about the variant or gene. Another important feature of Anfisa is that the user, at any time during the analysis, can query to identify any of the millions of variants in a whole genome.\r\n\r\nApplication\r\n=========\r\n\r\nForome Anfisa is being actively used in three diverse and complementary projects: SEQaBOO (SEQuencing a Baby for an Optimal Outcome), Brigham Genomic Medicine (BGM)/Harvard Undiagnosed Disease Network Clinical Site and research cohort analysis of purpura fulminans (PF) patients.\r\n\r\nSEQaBOO is a clinical research project initiated in Boston aimed at integrating high-throughput clinical-grade genomic analysis into routine newborn screening. For SEQaBOO, we have developed a filtration algorithm for the phenotype of congenital deafness. Its application typically selects 10 to 30 variants for further review from a genome. Anfisa has been applied to support a best-practice clinical variant filtration, analysis, and reporting workflow of 40 cases of suspected congenital hearing loss.\r\n\r\nBGM uses a phenotype-agnostic approach to analyze rare disease cases refractory to clinical analysis for novel genetic mechanisms of disease. With Forome Anfisa, the search for possible causal variants is performed in two stages. The first stage applies a decision tree to discard variants that are extremely unlikely to be related to the case. The result of this stage is a set of a few hundred variants that are rare, have functional significance (e.g. missense) and fit into one of possible inheritance models. In the second step, we drill down into this set, first by applying predefined filters based on potential inheritance models: autosomal dominant, X-linked and two recessive filters - homozygous recessive and compound heterozygous. If predefined filters yield no obvious result, they can be interactively adjusted for alternative inheritance hypotheses (e.g. imprinted genes) are explored. The compound heterozygous variant caller built into Anfisa allows flexible and interactive combinations of transcript and gene specific annotations into a complex search criteria.\r\n\r\nThe PF research study uses the cohort analysis capabilities within Forome Anfisa. A population of 481 samples is divided into three cohorts: PF patients, sepsis patients without PF, and control cohort. Filters used are based on a variant being present in specific cohort and combination of its frequencies within the cohorts.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe Forome Genomics Platform is being developed by an international community with contributors coming from the USA, Russia, UK, Austria and Canada. We are always looking for more contributors from other places. \r\n\r\nScientists and engineers speak different languages, have different mentality and often incompatible work habits. Writing software to provide routine solutions for a problem that just a few years ago nobody knew how to solve adds to the challenges. These problems are especially exacerbated in a distributed team developing a new open source software. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to tackle these challenges, if you think that what we are doing is interesting and useful, please join our community and let us continue to work together.\r\n\r\n",

    "abstract": "Airbnb acquired Luxury Retreats in 2017. In 2019 the entirety of the Luxury Retreats business was migrated over to Airbnb's technical stack, all while maintaining business continuity. This talk will share this journey as a case study, covering technical details, challenges, and key takeaways.",
    "description": "In 2019, Airbnb decided to migrate the entirety of the Luxury Retreats business onto the Airbnb technical stack. Post acquisition migrations are an often overlooked but absolutely critical part of acquisitions. In this talk we will go through the journey together, covering technical details, challenges, and key takeaways. The following is an outline of the presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Outline\r\n\r\n### 1.  Why did we decide to migrate as opposed to support two stacks?\r\n*Lessons we learned along the way that you can take away from.*\r\n\r\nPost acquisition, Luxury Retreats operated on its own tech stack independently of Airbnb's. We began to notice the following drawbacks:\r\n\r\n-   Difficulty of collaboration — different codebases and tools made it difficult for engineering and data science to collaborate across the two stacks\r\n-   Large maintenance cost — maintaining two sets of software on different technical stacks created significant overhead and required two distinct sets of engineers, one for each platform\r\n-   Inability to leverage Airbnb Platform — being on a different stack meant LR would be unable to take advantage of core platform features available on Airbnb (experimentation, internationalization, security/fraud checks, etc)\r\n\r\nWe decided that migrating over to Airbnb's tech stack would be well worth the investment and lay a strong foundation to future growth.\r\n\r\n### 2.  What strategies did we employ to execute the migration?\r\n*The technical complexity here was high and we had to keep the business running throughout the entire process*\r\n\r\nLuxury Retreats is a complicated business. Behind the website and app, we also had villa management tools, salesforce instances, calendar and pricing databases, and data reporting pipelines.\r\n\r\nThe Luxury Retreats migration involved many interdependencies. This played a factor in deciding the sequencing of the various pieces that needed to migrate. In broad terms, we went with the following sequencing.\r\n\r\n1.  Read paths\r\n2.  Write paths\r\n\r\nRead-only products such as the website and iOS app launched first. By doing this, we were able to keep the source of truth constant. Writes would continue to happen on the legacy side, with changes synced over from LR to Airbnb. Following that, products that impacted the write path, such as host tools to create and modify listings and agent tools to create bookings were launched. These changes would allow us to move the source of truth over to Airbnb’s infrastructure transparently to the clients.\r\n\r\n### 3.  How did we leverage Airbnb's infrastructure to rebuild the Luxury Retreats website?\r\n*An architecture deep dive as well as key concerns and challenges that were tackled.*\r\n\r\nWe rebuilt the entirety of the Luxury Retreats website on Airbnb's infrastructure. We decided to maintain as much design and feature parity as possible to limit the variable effects on business performance. By leveraging Airbnb's infrastructure for traffic, server side react rendering, api gateway, backend services, we were able to rebuild the entire website in a time frame of several months.\r\n![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/xy99pxs.png)\r\nKey concerns include handling inconsistencies between search and regions between the two products, and backwards incompatible differences in URL structures for region and villa detail pages.\r\n\r\n### 4.  What did the data warehouse migration entail?\r\n*A critical and often overlooked piece of the infrastructure.*\r\n\r\nThe data warehouse and ETL pipelines between Luxury Retreats and Airbnb were very different. Luxury Retreats used SQL Server and even had an unknown number os Excel sheets configured to have read or write access into the data warehouse.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, accounting principles and operational terminologies were different. We had to undertake innovative solutions to consolidate differences in revenue tracking.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a continuous view of the business, we had to move Luxury Retreats' historical data over to Airbnb's data warehouse, which meant mapping and migrating data fields properly.\r\n\r\nBefore and after of the data warehouse\r\n![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/yPiIUvH.png)\r\n### 5.  How did we roll out the new website?\r\n*A technical deep dive on the website rollout and business performance confidence through AB testing.*\r\n\r\nWith a project of this magnitude with so many moving parts, it’s important to keep in mind that at the end of the day business continuity is critical. Taking the product down or negatively impacting the conversion rate would be disastrous for the business and would go against the goal of migration, which was to lay the foundation and groundwork for future work to grow the business.\r\n\r\nIt was critical to our success to quantify the guest impact of the migration. Given the seasonality of the business, the most accurate way to do this was by running an AB test of user facing products. This was challenging because it involved testing two entirely different web stacks.\r\n\r\nThe following steps demonstrate the path towards being fully on Airbnb’s web infrastructure in four phases.\r\n\r\n1.  Copy over all DNS records from LR name server to Airbnb’s name server, and update our domain registration to point to the correct server accordingly.  \r\n2.  Update DNS record to point to Akamai, Airbnb’s CDN provider which forwards the request to the load balancer. This step is transparent and gives us a platform upstream for both legacy and Airbnb load balancers where we can deploy business logic.  \r\n3.  Use the CDN to send partial traffic to the Airbnb web stack. This is the phase with live experimentation.  \r\n4.  Update CDN so that 100% of LR web traffic goes to new Airbnb web stack, and deprecate all legacy web components.\r\n\r\nThe web rollout experiment was subject to a tight timeline. Due to the migration sequencing, the web rollout was first, and any delays would block the rollout of subsequent tracks. The following describes the preparations we made ahead of going live to ensure a smooth rollout.\r\n\r\n**Power analysis**\r\n\r\nMore data means more statistical confidence in results. Relative to Airbnb, Luxury Retreats has a lower booking volume, and has a concept of an inquiry that can mature into a booking. In order to prepare an experimentation plan, we calculated the MDEs (minimum detectable effects) of various metrics under consideration at various P values. That data gave us the ability to make an informed tradeoff between how long to run the experiment and the statistical confidence of changes in the metrics that we were evaluating.\r\n\r\n**Target metrics**\r\n\r\nAs with any experiment, it was important to pre-define what the target metrics were - the primary indicators to consider concluding the experiment and shipping to 100%.\r\n\r\nFrom our power analysis, given the lead time required for an inquiry to turn into a booking, it would not have been feasible to use bookings as a target metric for a short experiment duration.\r\n\r\nWe sought out a metric that was a leading indicator of bookings that had more reasonable MDEs. We ended up choosing “Contacts” (inquires + online bookings), which had a much more manageable MDE of detecting a 10% change within 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nOne issue with looking solely at contacts was around the quality of contacts. For example, a product change that introduces confusion may encourage more visitors to inquire, but those incremental inquiries may not lead to additional bookings; this change may actually be bad for the business. In order to address this, we introduced “High Intent Inquiries” as the second target metric that would help us quantify changes to the website. To measure intent, we created an inquiry scoring ML model that took a variety of user signals to generate a quality score. We set a predefined threshold to classify the inquiry as high intent based on signals collected at the time of submission. “High intent inquiries” had a MDE of 15% change within 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nUltimately we decided to use contacts and high intent inquiries as our two target metrics for the web experiment.\r\nFunnel events\r\n\r\nWe sought to define and implement Google Analytics events for all events in the funnel across both the old and new website. This was important for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  Events were required in order to build metrics for the experiment\r\n2.  Comprehensive funnel events would allow us to course correct during the experimentation period (there would be no time to add logs and wait several days to collect more data)\r\n    \r\nThis was challenging because the product and implementation differed in many areas; we had to use the same funnel but implement the events in a way that was consistent and meaningful.\r\n\r\nWe also built out an experimentation dashboard on Tableau that utilized the GA events and reported daily on all funnel events so we could closely track and monitor performance.\r\n\r\n**Launch plan**\r\n\r\nBefore starting the experiment, we aligned with all stakeholders on the following plan and launch criteria.\r\n\r\n1.  The experiment would last for 2 weeks\r\n2.  As long as the target metrics of Contacts and High Intent Inquiries did not drop more than the predefined threshold, the statistically significantly detectable amount (P=0.05) for that time frame, we could launch to 100% the new website.\r\n\r\n**Outcome**\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment was live, we monitored the performance in terms of movements in funnel metrics on a daily basis. We shipped product changes during the experimentation phase based on funnel metrics, so the positive impact was likely to be underrepresented in the final set of cumulative data. We reported on the target metrics, their delta, and their confidence interval using a [one tailed test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-_and_two-tailed_tests), as lifts in key metrics would not be launch blockers.\r\n\r\nThe analysis showed fluctuations on contacters, high intent contacts, and low intent contacts within low digit percentage points. Additionally, the one tailed test showed that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was within our predefined criteria. We believed this outcome validates our hypothesis that we successfully migrated without any impact to our users, and rolled out to 100% of users.",

    "description": "If you've ever used a dating app, you'll probably agree that they can feel tedious and like a waste of time: you go there every day to swipe left or right almost arbitrarily, only based on a few pictures and a scarce bio, and then hope for a match to finally get to chat with someone. Is there a way to skip the grunt work and get to the interesting part? That's what I asked myself six months ago when I built Swipr, a tool written in JavaScript that automates this process. In this talk we'll see how the project came to be, how it evolved to what it is today and all the challenges it faced. We'll also take a look at how it actually works, discussing architectural choices and learning about good tools and practices to write command line apps with Node.js along the way.",
    "notes": "# Tentative talk outline\r\n\r\n## The problem with dating apps\r\n\r\n### Facts\r\n\r\n- Most popular dating apps are about choosing people based on pictures\r\n- Women are much more selective than men in general (*)\r\n- There is usually a limit in the number of likes you can give\r\n\r\n### Consequences\r\n\r\n- Can feel arbitrary and promote superficiality\r\n- Hurts less good-looking people, especially men (**)\r\n- Pushes you to come back every day\r\n\r\n### Workaround: like everybody\r\n\r\n- Waste of time. Still requires you to go back to the app everyday.\r\n- Waste of chances. Some of your likes will go to profiles without pictures, or empty descriptions, etc.\r\n\r\n### How the tool helps\r\n\r\n- Likes or passes on people based on configurable preferences. Eg, min number of pictures, min number of words in bio, like back if you've been liked before.\r\n- Similar to the like everybody strategy, but a bit more selective and automatic (unattended)\r\n\r\n(*) The average woman likes 12% of men on Tinder\r\n\r\n(**) Men of average attractiveness can expect to be liked by 0.87% of women (1 for every 115), vs 20% for most attractive men\r\n\r\nData from [https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a)\r\n\r\n## Origins and evolution\r\n\r\n- Started as a browser automation script with Puppeteer, to take advantage of Tinder's webapp\r\n- Realized the Tinder API was fairly straightforward by looking at the network requests with browser dev tools and some unofficial documentation online\r\n- Rebuilt it as a command line tool with Node.js\r\n- Could be turned into a website, but for recurring unattended use the server would need to store credentials with all the implications this would have\r\n- Maybe an Electron app that sets up a background process to be run daily would work\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\n### Architecture\r\n\r\n- Module that deals with API calls with different layers: network requests, authentication and token injection, response parsing and data transformation to domain models, semantic error handling.\r\n- Module for console logging. Abstracts details away ensuring consistent message formatting by exporting semantic functions (eg, printTitle, printLike, printSuccess).\r\n- Module for config storage, including validation.\r\n- Module with misc utility functions.\r\n- Main module that handles UI and user input and coordinates calls to the other ones.\r\n\r\n### Tools and libraries\r\n- System access: processes, commands, files\r\n- Prompts and interaction: commander, inquirer, chalk, cli-spinner, gluegun, oclif, node-notifier\r\n- User settings: configstore, dotenv\r\n- Distribution: npm, pkg, update-notifier\r\n\r\nRepository for Swipr (working proof of concept): [https://github.com/soyguijarro/swipr](https://github.com/soyguijarro/swipr)\r\n\r\n# Speaking experience\r\n\r\n[https://speakerdex.co/soyguijarro](https://speakerdex.co/soyguijarro)",

How CLI apps can increase your width of solving engineering problems.\n\nYes? Cool then, let's dive.",
    "description": "---\r\n## Why this talk? | Relevance\r\n\r\nCommand line applications are a very fast,  effective and powerful way to do things. And there is a time in every developer's carrier where he/she needs to **automate the things** and even want to change the automation according to the situation. And while doing these task he/she wants to build this thing in a very **short time** because this **thing is a part of a very big project**. Backend developers and system admins are usually experiencing these things more than half a year.\r\n\r\nBackend developers also are not very much into the user interface and system admins just hate that. So for them, command line applications are like a big relief.\r\n\r\nIf you are one of them then I can explain to you how:\r\n\r\n* **Why** a CLI app could be the best solution for that problem?\r\n* **When** to actually take this approach?\r\n* The **constraints** we face.\r\n* **How** in **Ruby** we can make them.\r\n\r\nAnd **my experience** of how, when, and why I made them when I faced the same issue I discussed above.\r\n \r\n\r\n---\r\n## Coverage\r\n\r\n* **Why this talk? and why me?**: I will show you the importance of command line apps and how we can use them in our applications (maybe like an add-on with Rails).\r\n\r\nHow they can be used to increase your level as a software developer and land you on a better job.\r\n\r\nAnd most important, *why you should listen to me* when you have such a great line of the speakers? If you don't like it till now, you are free to go. \r\n\r\n\u003e First I want the audience to have an interest in this. After that, I will dive into the topic.\r\n\r\n* **Architecture**: First we will look into the architecture of these CLI apps. This would help us understand how efficient they are and what they are capable of. And especially answer the **why** we should use them.\r\n\r\n* **Work Flow \u0026 Where it fits?**: This section explains the flow of operations when you execute a command. Here we see **when** and **where** they are a good fit to implement. \r\n\r\n* **Creating our own with Ruby**: Yes, what is the importance of above all things, if you don't have your own personal CLI. \r\n\r\nIn this, we will see how we can create our own CLI apps with **our favorite language Ruby**.\r\n\r\n* **Questions**: Throw as many doubts or question you have for me. I will be more than happy to resolve those, with best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Timeline\r\nBelow is the timeline I have prepared for my talk of about 55 minutes:\r\n\r\n* **5 minutes**: Why this talk and why me?\r\n* **10 minutes**: Architecture of CLI apps\r\n* **15 minutes**: When to use them?\r\n* **10 minutes**: Workflow of CLI apps\r\n* **10 minutes**: Making our CLI app in Ruby\r\n* **2 minutes**: Questions \r\n* **3 minutes**: 'Growing as a software engineer'. This is a thing I want to share with the community. It's about the things we as a software engineer should do in order to grow. I have implemented them in my life and within my college life, I have seen the results. It doesn't matter at what level attendees are in their career, I am sure there are some values in this section they all can have. Just want to share this.\r\n\r\nFor more discussions catch me up at the conference.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Takeaway\r\n\r\n* A feeling of **level up** in their professional career as a software developer, as now they are ready with an idea on how to face an add-on software like problems in the **short span of time**.\r\n\r\n* A good basic understanding of CLI apps and how to make them in Ruby.\r\n\r\n* A fun session and in an awesome conference.",

Event Sourcing is a closely related technique that stores state as a series of events as opposed to only keeping track of the latest data. While these concepts are important on their own right, they are especially important for microservices development.\r\n\r\nIn this heavily demo driven session we explore CQRS and Event Sourcing in detail using the Axon Java framework. At the end of the session you should have a good idea if CQRS and Event Sourcing are for you and why Axon helps in implementing these concepts.\r\n\r\nAttendees get a complete project to kick start their Axon framework discovery and implementation.\r\n",

    "description": " #### The problem:\r\n\r\n\u003e The applications in finance and healthcare etc domain data privacy are a major concern. \r\nThey also have to comply with **GDPR**, **HIPPA** etc which do not allow them to share data with third-party applications in normal circumstances. So for error tracking, suggested tools like Sentry and Rollbar were not approved.\r\n\r\n#### Objective:\r\n\u003e To build an efficient error tracking tool in ruby and display them on UI mounted inside the same application.\r\n\r\n#### Solution:\r\nWe built a gem named **Specterr** using **instrumentation API**. \r\n\r\nThe instrumentation API provided by Active Support allows developers to provide hooks which other developers may hook into. There are several of these within the Rails framework. With this API, developers can choose to be notified when certain events occur inside their application or another piece of Ruby code.\r\n\r\nWe are leveraging these notifications to track errors. Storing them inside the DB configured by the user, not over the cloud. We are mounting **Rack-based UI** to display errors captured.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are two parts of the gem \r\n - one which captures the errors and stores it. \r\n - Other is a mountable UI to display them. \r\n \r\n We got a chance to explore following components which are generally unexplored by common rails developer: \r\n- The instrumentation API \u0026 Rails **PubSub architecture**\r\n- Gem mounted with the Rack-based engine.",

Is :focus given that much thought since browser's style these by default?

How can we make the web a more inclusive place while maintaining design intent?.\r\n\r\nAs we build more and more things on the web, we must do our part in building awesome, accessible user experiences. Except native default browser styling of the :focus pseudo class is rather blah, don't you think? There has to be a better way to add some pizzazz to elements when users navigate without a mouse. In this talk, I will demo numerous ways to provide custom focus styles despite known limitations in the web platform.

    "description": "Early 2015, we were building a Single sign-on (SSO) solution to vast majority of our customers from scratch. Our previous datacenter deployments used to take roughly 3~4 hours(scripts+manual) on a maintenance window over the weekend.\r\n\r\nWe had many different pieces of clustered third party software . This includes but is not limited to OpenDJ,OpenAM, Vertica, and Hadoop. All of these pieces of software manage their configuration via some sort of internal database. Not necessarily a SQL database, but a database none the less. We would like to have a uniform mechanism for managing the cluster wide configuration of these various systems that takes care of some of the common problems of the idempotentcy of running a configuration script and additive configurations after a system is already in production so that individual developers no longer need to bear that cognitive load. This will reduce the number of issues that we have during deployments and reduce the amount of time it takes for developers and DevOps to write new configurations. This system should also support the files being used to configure a system being small and modular to enhance readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nEnter Scriptway. In Scriptway, we found a solution that empowers our developers to easily configure a development environment locally that is used for installation/configuration of software on local docker containers and production servers.\r\n\r\nScriptway maintains a schema is agnostic of the system that it is in. It should be the same whether version metadata info is being stored on the local file system, relational database, LDAP, etc. Version metadata is recorded when a script is run. If the version metadata file, table, ldap schema, etc doesn't exist already, it should be created automatically by the this tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nSession Outline:\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll discuss . We’ll cover:\r\n\r\n* A quick history of our deployment challenges and what led us to Scriptway.\r\n* The benefits of our new deployment approach — easy to Setup and minimal investment\r\n* How we combine Scriptway along with Docker, Ansible  and the Jfrog products like Artifactory for more streamlined continuous integration and deployment\r\n",

Shortly after that I became an avid gamer, only to again realize I didn’t just want to play video games - I wanted to develop them. Next came my passion for software development. Once more I desired to be the creator as opposed to the end user of a product or software. \r\n\r\nThe point I’m trying to make is this: whether I’m playing music or writing code, I always get the same deep sense of self-satisfaction, that pushes me to think outside the box and create new worlds for people everywhere to explore. This is what pushed me to make the best of all my software projects without being afraid of unknown languages or even built my own microcontrollers.\r\n",

    "bio": "# Introduce Yourself\r\n\r\nI am Ekansh Gupta (@eKuG, the reason behind this username is ‘eku’ is my nickname and ‘G’ is the initial of my surname), currently pursuing **engineering in Electrical branch from Delhi Technological University** (DTU) 2nd year, Delhi. Apart from this, I have various hobbies, for example, I love to swim, in social aspects my love for anime is unparallel and in my professional career I love shaping young minds has been much interest to me. My story starts way back when I started Grade 11, students in India mostly choose what they have to do in life during that year. When I started grade 11, I made my mind pursue engineering with Computer Science but wasn’t able due unforeseeable circumstances and restrictions which hampered my understanding of the syntax and programming languages that were new to me where everyone else was way ahead. Due to the competitive environment in my University, Guidance and mentors were very scarce. This became my motive in building a healthy technical environment.\r\n\r\n# Community Definition\r\n\r\nCommunity for me involves an aggregate of diverse minds coming together to share ideas, struggles, and resources in the spirit of collaboration. Community can be formed on the basis of community sentiment. It is extremely essential. It implies ‘a feeling of belonging together.” It is a ‘we-feeling’ among the members of a community. Because of this feeling, humans unleash their most valuable resources: creativity, imagination, and original thinking and makes them capable of thinking about others rather than just take actions out of self-interest. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind and some help from my seniors and friends, we were able to establish a student club known as *Android Techies* collecting likeminded people to develop and mentor students who were majorly associated and/or interested in Android. After completing a couple of projects in the industry, we felt that the need of other technical domains  such as ML, iOS, Game Dev, etc were also catching up and was in quite a lot of demand thereby expanding ourselves from Android to Open Source Development in all major programming languages and Competitive Programming rebranding ourselves as *Software Developers – DTU (SD-DTU)* becoming an official society recognised by college administration. \r\n\r\nHaving attended various technical conferences, events, and hackathons, our team got exposure to tech environment. We observed that the lack of a developing community has hindered the growth of various students across uncountable universities which paved our path for further expansion of our student-led organisation. SD-DTU was further expanded and renamed to *International Organisation of Software Developers (IOSD)* which we got registered to the Government of India. Due to the lack of guidance in various colleges, IOSD established student chapters at all the major colleges in and around Delhi, NCR. Every college chapter name is prefixed by IOSD. Leading the student chapters are the core team and its chapter head, and every chapter is officially registered and recognized by the university administration of where it has been established as a technical society of the college. For newbie developers, collaborating on open source projects is the fastest way to learn – it’s like labs for tutorials. For senior developers, contributing to and collaborating on open source help sate the desire to build cool things that matter, along with building up bragging rights in the tech community. We at IOSD are completing 4 years together with around 5000+ connected students pan India and I feel very proud to be a part of this wonderful organisation. Having started with 4-6 members, growing to where we are now, giving us all the opportunity to interact with a very vast and diverse crowd and shaped us to embark on any challenge that comes in our way.\r\n\r\n# What are your community's shared struggles?\r\n \r\nIOSD has always been focused to bridge the gap between the less and more privileged people which may include either educational level, monetary level or diversity. Due the lack of proper guidance for projects and collaborative learning, we initiated many special interest groups (SIGs) which can offer these resources in addition to developing skillset for jobs and placements. Our aim is the equip everyone, regardless of their major, with technical skills to increase their job prospects. IOSD’s Core Value include:\r\n* Education\r\n* Perseverance\r\n* Innovation\r\n* Collaboration\r\n* Creativity\r\n\r\n# What is the mission of your community?\r\n\r\nWe at IOSD have always focussed our resources for the upliftment of technical expertise amongst the community. To do so, SIGs are conducted both online and offline to make the students aware of rising technologies and world of Open Source. I have been in this community for about 4 years now and the kind of projects for the upliftment of society are unparalleled. **Projects ranging from those from Delhi and Arunachal Pradesh Police to United Nations, from college websites to full-fledged commercial websites and app deployments**, my journey with IOSD has been that of a pretty exciting yet fulfilling rollercoaster. Apart from Projects, *India’s biggest student run hackathon (HackDTU) was organised by IOSD at our college with the help of 400+ students from all over the country pooling the resources combining a cash prize of over 2.5 Lakhs for the winner. It was by far the epicentre of programming fuelled by coffee and energy drinks promoting the presence of open source as the core of IOSD.*\r\n\r\n# What do members look to get from your community?\r\n\r\nWith over 5000 members in just under 4 years of inception, communication has been very pivotal to our organisation. WhatsApp groups are made every year of graduation wise. Use of Slack and Gitter is very much promoted. But as we all know, how so ever the platform might be advanced, a student always gets inspirations from seniors when talking face to face or over call which is why, we at IOSD are always available to the organisation whatever the time/day it might be. \r\n\r\n# Future-proofing your community\r\n\r\nDue to the exponential growth of IOSD over the years, from last year we had decided to set up a base of all operations which can be termed as an HQ for centralised operations from where all major decisions are taken. The office also acts as a place for nurturing all interns who are unable to work from their home or college as a result of any pressure. The control over every student chapter is then decentralised to the core council of that college which is usually handled by the Pre-final years and sophomores. As the year progresses, students are monitored on the basis of their contributions in various domains not only technical development but overall holistic development. The freshers thereafter are given opportunity to take part and control the organisation and the college level. The organisation runs on a model of scalar chain. This way, the existence of monopoly and monotonous behaviour is rarely present and to the surface. \r\n\r\nAlthough I must tell you that the journey has not been easy. I have had my fair share of setbacks and failures. But in the end, these are the situations which make you stronger and help you succeed.\r\n\r\nSo, if there is any takeaway from this, it is to do what challenges your mind. Always be open to learn new skills and improve your abilities. This is the one and only way to grow as a person.\r\n\r\nI would like to conclude with the wise words of Ralph Waldo Emerson.\r\n \u003eAlways do what you are afraid to do\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Student Partner | Facilitator at Mozilla | International Organisation of Software Developers | Data Science and Machine Learning Enthusiast",

In order for people to understand how to shape the Web – or even how to keep themselves safe online, or make a living with the Internet – there is a growing need to make sure everyone has the skills they need for healthy Internet citizenship. It needs to be realized that people who grew up with access to the Internet don’t automatically develop strong web literacy skills. We should resist the deepening of divides between the few who know how the technology works, and a majority who do not. We need everyone to recognize that Web literacy is more than coding. Web literacy is more than coding. Governments, educators and parents need to be champions for Web literacy and foster creative opportunities for young people to develop these skills. Technology Companies also need Web Literacy to engage with people. ",

    "description": "Most of the Single Page Applications, and Angular is not an exception here, manifest one common problem. They are not SEO/CDN/prefetching friendly. \r\n\r\nSome could ask “Why should I care about that? My application bootstraps in the browser and looks awesome”, and they are right, as long as they are well-known companies who don’t need to position themselves on the market, AND their applications are closed ecosystems. In any other case, SEO and prefetching is a “to be or not to be” of the application. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to move Angular rendering process to the server and deliver richer content to the browser instead of pure index.html with tones of JavaScript? Yes, there is! It is called Angular Universal, and thanks to it, we achieve much faster First Meaningful Paint of our website! However, there are some pitfalls and risks as well...\r\n\r\nDuring this talk I will cover how to implement server-side rendering (an official angular guide; and an alternative way by using schematics from ng-toolkit project); and how to deal with the problem which developers encounter while working with SSR:\r\n\r\n- how to execute different code on NodeJS and inside the browser (different global objects available in both environments); with a real-life example: internationalization with ngx-translate (loading translations via HTTP and directly from the file system)\r\n- How to convey to the browser the information that the back-end already did external API calls and there is no need to repeat them.\r\n- How to abandon long-time calls to inefficient endpoints, and avoid delays in the server-side rendering process.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I will mention an alternative to SSR - prerendering, a process of rendering all subpages at the build time, and compare both techniques.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I am mentioning my publications about SSR, as a reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/encrypting-cookies-angular-universal-node-js\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/expedited-two-factor-authentication-angular-twilio-authy\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/transfer-files-data-javascript-applications-angular-node-js\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/faster-javascript-web-apps-angular-universal-transferstate-api-watchdog\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/create-search-engine-friendly-internationalized-web-apps-angular-universal-ngx-translate\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/angular-universal-javascript-node-js-aws-lambda",

    "abstract": "With Angular Universal, you can bootstrap application on the server-side and respond to your user with a fully rendered view. Apart from that, you can execute additional logic and work with sensitive data (ie: private keys) on the server-side. Learn how to do that, and about best practices.",
    "description": "In this talk I want to cover advanced usage of Angular Universal. I am going to perform a presentation together with the \"live coding\" (to be sure, that nothing will fail I am going to use recorded macros). In the presentation part I want to discuss Angular Universal and describe case study: Angular application with public available page, and protected content behind the two-factor authentication. The task which I want to perform is introducing Server-Side rendering to the application, read cookie values on the server-side to decide what content should be rendered for the authenticated user. I am also going to introduce the 'remember me' option and returning user case study, to present how shared code-base (front-end \u0026 back-end) can use sensitive data like encryption key and do not compromise them.\r\n\r\nThose are main points of the talk:\r\n\r\n1. Angular Universal introduction (why? What are benefits?)\r\n2. Case study, overview of the application architecture (public available page, protected pages behind the two-factor authentication)\r\n3. Introducing server-side rendering to the application\r\n4. Reading cookie values (deterring if user is logged in)\r\n5. Performing request for two factor authentication from the back-end (using private key, to authenticate application with the two-factor system)\r\n6. Summarize and overview of what was implemented.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I am going to mention and use as a resource for further reading following articles:\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/encrypting-cookies-angular-universal-node-js\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/expedited-two-factor-authentication-angular-twilio-authy\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/transfer-files-data-javascript-applications-angular-node-js\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/faster-javascript-web-apps-angular-universal-transferstate-api-watchdog\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/create-search-engine-friendly-internationalized-web-apps-angular-universal-ngx-translate\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/angular-universal-javascript-node-js-aws-lambda",

    "title": "Three Questions Technologists Should Be Asking Themselves",
    "abstract": "Is it scalable?\nIs it secure?\nIs it maintainable?\n\nThese three questions are the most powerful tools technologists and developers can ask themselves. At every stage, for every product, these questions allow you to future proof and mitigate risk.",
    "description": "These three questions are the most powerful tool any developer can wield: \r\n\"Is it scalable?\"\r\n\"Is it secure?\"\r\n\"Is it maintainable?\"\r\n\r\nEvery line of code, function, class, script, file, project, UML diagram, database, concept, proposed solution, and architecture should stand up to these these questions. I've shutdown long winded meetings by asking these questions. I've written some of the most beautiful code I'd ever seen, reevaluated, and dumped it. I've even had managers hand me an award for asking these questions and keeping them honest. These questions are immensely valuable! Lets break them down:\r\n\r\nIs it Scalable?\r\n---------------------\r\nThis is probably the most complicated question of them all. We can't just write one off code. Devs tell ourselves that we will just \"come back to that part and refactor when the time comes\" but how often to we get that luxury? When we build something and it has an inherit flaw from the beginning, we're setting ourselves up for failure.\r\n\r\nThis is the place where UI/UX come into play as well. We can't lock the UI because we're waiting on a call to server side. You can manually train 5 users on this interface now, but when it grows to 20, they need to be able to figure it out themselves.\r\n\r\nHard lessons are learned here. Widgets fail here.\r\n\r\nA word of caution on this though, oftentimes we end up in a trap of \"analysis paralysis\". Anything can be scaled infinitely with infinite resources. We might not have those resources (read time, money, patience) to make this fully scalable at the moment. Note these points and communicate! \"We don't have X so there is an upper limit of Y\". One of two things may happen here; you scare somebody into getting the resources you need or you are told you can come back later.\r\n\r\nIs it Secure?\r\n---------------------\r\n![That's not my department](https://media3.giphy.com/media/kqQwLMXzBmmQg/source.gif)\r\n\r\nWe often don't want to admit it, but security really is our department. We can harden every server, lock access to every database, and make our environment look like Fort Knox but if we write a back door into something or create a huge vulnerability, all of that is for nothing. \r\n\r\n[Take a look at the HITECH act, specifically section 13404c](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/hitechact.pdf).\r\n\r\n\u003e c) APPLICATION OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.—In the\u003e case of a business associate that violates any provision of subsection\u003e (a) or (b), the provisions of sections 1176 and 1177 of the Social\u003e Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d–5, 1320d–6) shall apply to the business associate with respect to such violation in the same manner\u003e as such provisions apply to a person who violates a provision\u003e of part C of title XI of such Act. \r\n\r\nGuess what! We're that \"Business Associate\" (yes, even as a contractor). That means that as a developer, we can be held _**PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE**_ in the case of a leak of PII or HIPAA data!\r\n\r\nThis goes way beyond just HIPAA and PII though. We never store or transmit plain text credentials, we prevent script and SQL injection. We validate data on the client side AND the server side. Libraries from sources we don't know are on the naughty list and we _NEVER_ set them to auto update for the same reason.\r\nThe same logic from above applies, you probably are not going to get the time to \"fix it later\", do it correctly now.\r\n\r\nIs it Maintainable?\r\n---------------------\r\nThis question is the most easily dismissed. Of course we can maintain it! We wrote it! Can we though? We're rock stars! We are constantly building, fixing and going to meetings. In one week, one month, or one year's time are you going to be able to handle the fly-bys, one off change requests and break-fix this code needs? Now we have to deliver on our current project _AND_ help with the dev effort on our last project. It gets over whelming and leads to a huge amount of burn out.\r\nMaybe we want to import a library we love. But what happens when support for that library goes away or the updates stop coming? Are others on our team going to be able to fix issues when that black box no longer works and nobody can contact the dev?\r\n\r\nYes, yes comments go here too but we can't forget about code readability! It does no good if I hire a junior and it takes them 6 months to a year to get up to speed. We can write dazzling one liner conditionals in Javascript but they are hard to read and understand. Every language has this issue, it's not just Javascript. Avoid the confusion, white space is our friend!",

However, for folks stepping into the new paradigm the concepts/patterns and principles of DDD seem daunting. The Practical DDD session aims to simplify the various concepts/principles and patterns of DDD in a manner which is easily consumable, relateable and practical within the context of an execution platform like Jakarta EE / Spring Boot / MicroProfile and the Axon Framework.\r\n\r\nAs a developer/architect or technical leader, using the tools/frameworks that you currently use or are familiar with is the fastest way for adopting a new design paradigm.\r\n\r\nThis session aims to do exactly that. The attendees are first taken through a quick introduction to the major DDD concepts using a reference application (Cargo Tracker). Attendees learn about DDD concepts such as Domain Models/Domain Rules and Domain Supporting Services not just in theory but through references to Cargo Tracker. \r\n\r\nThe next part of the session walks through 4 detailed DDD implementations utiling 4 leading Java Frameworks. Each of these implementations map concepts of DDD (e.g. Bounded Contexts/Aggregates) to the corresponding available tools within the specific platform\r\n\r\n- The first implementation will be based on a monolithic architecture using Jakarta EE\r\n- The second implementation will be based on a microservices architecture using Eclipse MicroProfile (Project Helidon)\r\n- The third implementation will be based on a microservices architecture using Spring Boot / Spring Cloud and Spring Cloud Streams\r\n- The final implementation will be the most advanced implementation using a CQRS/ES architecture using the Axon framework\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, attendees using any one of these platforms get a relatable pathway to the adoption of DDD for their enterprise applications. Attendees get complete working source code for the 4 implementations.\r\n",

This is a team, that I lead, that all devs spend anywhere from 4-7 months on to continue to get comfortable with all of our patterns with the help of senior developers like myself. This allows for our other senior developers to focus on the more challenging projects, and mentoring mid-level developers. \r\n\r\nI would love to share what we've learned, and how we've improved the onboarding period, to other attendees of the conference so that we our hard work can expand all throughout Omaha, and beyond.",

    "description": "Come with me if you want to live... without confusing state management! State machines enforce a simple set of rules for your application state - a single state is allowed at any given time and only certain transitions can be made between states. These explicit rules lead to more predictable code and fewer bugs. In this talk, we'll discover what state machines are and learn how they can be incorporated into modern applications. We'll also see how using state machines can help communicate meaning and encode business logic across teams (and beyond just developers). You'll leave with an understanding of how to effectively create and use state machines for your own applications while keeping the business logic clean and declarative. Terminate complexity with state machines! 👍",

    "description": "If you're a programmer who has ever found themselves inadvertently (perhaps unwillingly!) straddling the line between design and code, this is the talk for you.\r\n\r\nEven with zero design training or background, there are numerous small, simple and practical ways you can vastly improve the look and usability of a website. In this talk, we’ll explore 10 of them together, using research and proven solutions to see how the impact as a whole for both clients and users is greater than the sum of its parts.",
    "notes": "For this talk, I explore ten different facets of basic web design, using research to back up my guidelines, and I present them in a structured, easy-to-follow format.\r\n\r\nI touch on three main categories:\r\n\r\n* Words\r\n* Images\r\n* Design as a whole\r\n\r\nThe talk is aimed at people with little-to-no design experience, so we talk about everything from padding for textboxes and appropriate uses for icons to a rundown of progressive disclosure and the F-shape reading pattern. I incorporate constant examples, and provide a list of resources at the end for attendees to further their exploration. I encourage questions throughout the presentation, and incorporate interaction throughout.\r\n\r\n**Pitch**\r\n\r\nMy current job is full-stack developer for a small web and mobile consulting company, but I spent years working in creative fields (writing, designing) before deciding to do web development full-time; this is in contrast to most of my coworkers, who don’t have any design experience.\r\n\r\nPeople who don’t consider themselves “creative” often assume they can’t learn to be, and tend to box themselves in. But there are basic aspects of design that can be broken down for even the most back-end-centric developer, to the overwhelming benefit of everyone. Even clients who can’t afford or aren’t interested in full-scale design packages still expect (and deserve) solid usability (and websites that aren’t ugly), and just like with back-end functionality, it saves untold amounts of time to do the small stuff the right way from the beginning (rather than going back later and trying to fix what’s broken).\r\n\r\nDevelopers want to do good work, including in areas they're not experienced in: all they need are the right tools.",

In most explanations, UX and UI design are presented as separate disciplines altogether, and although they are different concepts, in the practice of design they are more connected than most people think. So for those people still trying to make sense of this, in this talk goes my attempt at demystifying UX and UI.\r\nIn most cases when we refer to UX or UI we are talking from the perspective of the *USER* who’s using an interface and having an experience. That’s all fine and good, but that’s just one angle. It just so happens that there’s another perspective that gets shuffled into the conversation when referring to UX/UI, and that’s the perspective of the *DESIGNER*. I’ll deconstruct these concepts in both dimensions, with the hope of clearing up the murky water around this topic.\r\n\r\n###2nd part###\r\nAbout the evaluation heuristics, what are they, how to use them, how to take advantage of them?! and a lot of examples. This is the main part of my talk.\r\n\r\n###3rd part###\r\nThis part is constructed to be quick yet effective. It is assumed that the audience will be a bit tired after a long presentation so they will only want something quick, funny, and easy to be understood :)\r\nI'll talk about: \r\n- The do's and don'ts of UX focusing on a.\"The need for research\", b.\"Choosing the right method\" c.\"Execution makes it or breaks it\".\r\n- Good and the bad UI designers, where I basically do a comparison between these two kinds of designers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guidelines I will be presenting are general rules of thumb and will mostly be applicable to any web and mobile application with some exceptions.\r\nMy talk will be more focused on mobile/web applications rather than on physical products.

    "notes": "GENERAL:\r\n\r\n###Is this a formal or informal talk?### \r\nFrom my perspective, this is going to be a structured talk (with slides), but I am planning on engaging the audience with questions, their opinions and hopefully laughs. I’m not going to be deadly serious, in fact, I’ll have a playful tone and I’ll include my personal experiences.\r\n\r\n###Why do I believe I am the right candidate for this conference?###\r\nI know what I’m talking about. I’m not talking about theoretical things, but things that have worked in action and are proven with surveys, statistics, articles and practical examples. \r\nThis talk is based on UX and UI principals manifested by Jakob Nielson and Don Norman.\r\n\r\n###What makes me an expert?###\r\n- Professionally: I work as an App developer and I am taking over freelancing jobs as a UX/UI designer. I have created my own online-course \"Introduction to UX\" which is published on Skillshare. From time to time I write articles about UX/UI and front-end development and I publish them -mostly- on Medium. I also create videos where I talk about best practices and how to make things to work.\r\n- Academically: I 've graduated from an engineering university, most specifically from the departure of \"Informatics and telecommunications of engineering\". Currently, I am continuing my studies by doing a master focused on UX/UI.\r\n\r\n###Public speaking experience?###\r\n- [PyWebConf](https://2019.pyconweb.com/#program) in Germany | \r\n- [AppForum, Zebra](https://web.cvent.com/event/21819552-145e-484d-81dd-01c87826c291/websitePage:4a9f1ae7-fd5e-40ea-a47b-8748de11f650?RefId=Home) in Poland |\r\n- [codegarden18](https://codegarden18.com/) in Denmark | \r\n- [UUDF](https://www.duugfest.nl/) in the Netherlands |\r\n- [IWD19 Warri](https://youtu.be/gLINIFXlXuw) in Nigeria (remotely) |\r\n- On my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/EleftheriaBatsou) | \r\n- Upcoming: [Devops Unicorns](https://2019.devopsunicorns.com/) in Latvia / [CFCamp](https://www.cfcamp.org/) in Germany /  [Let’s test](http://lets-test.com/?page_id=5795) in South Africa \r\n\r\n###Speaker’s bio:### \r\nThe speaker is a passionate Front end developer and UX/UI Researcher from Greece. She is working as an App Developer while taking up a master's degree in Graphic Arts and Multimedia. She is also creating educational content for several platforms such as Packt, Udemy, Skillshare, at the same time, she produces motivational talks and how-to videos on her youtube channel. She is self-motivated and working hard to make this world a little bit better every day.\r\nWhen she isn't glued to a computer screen, the speaker spends time working out and strolling in the nature.

    "description": "When starting to learn functional programming, one typically starts off with a simple problem or kata where error conditions can be ignored or hand-waved away which allows one to focus on the business logic. Eventually, however, you will need to expand your knowledge to deal with the absence of values and error conditions.\r\n\r\nUnlike most Object-Oriented languages which leverage nulls or exceptions, functional languages tend to encode these error conditions into types like Maybe and Either which the compiler then can enforce that the developer handles the error. However, how does one combine these types to accomplish a flow of logic in your application?\r\n\r\nIn this session, I'll show you what these two different types are, how to refactor your code to leverage these types and apply a technique known as Railway Oriented Programming to handle your error conditions in a more concise manner.\r\n\r\nIntended for those new to functional programming, by the end of this session, you will know when to use Maybe and Either in your codebase, how to refactor existing code to leverage these types, and how to combine these concepts into a pipeline leveraging Railway Oriented Programming.

    "description": "In 2006, The Walt Disney Company purchased Pixar, appointed Pixar’s leadership over Disney Animation Studios, and cross their fingers that Buzz Lightyear’s magic would rub off on Disney’s struggling animation division. Disney Animation seemed to complete its transformation with the release of Frozen in 2013 grossing $1.3B. The revolutionary outcome of Disney’s transformation is that there was little turnover. When asked how he transformed Disney Animation, Pixar’s President and Cofounder, Ed Catmull responded:  \r\n\r\n“We put in some new systems, they learned new ways of interacting, and they changed their behavior, and now they are a completely different group of people when they work together.” \r\n\r\nCreators of digital properties, apps, and websites have long started efforts with design comps—static pictures that represent how the coded version should appear. That process is failing us. We don’t need to fire everyone and start over, and, like Disney, we need some new systems and structures to help our teams interact differently. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will discover how component libraries are the key to unlock our team’s potential and tech-neutral language for discussing them and implementing them.

Keeping a hands-on role helps me maximize the potential of multi-disciplinary teams and create sustainable, nimble digital experiences and technical solutions.\r\n\r\nI have spent 15 years building organizations (startups, nonprofits, and enterprise) in the Midwest region by spearheading digital strategy and content delivery. That includes countless hours coaching professionals and students on building applications, creating digital experiences, and installing systems in their businesses. I currently serve as a technology consultant at Slalom St. Louis.\r\n\r\nHere is a recent example of my speaking from an internal learning festival at Slalom: https://youtu.be/dRzRxMnEdL8\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I am a husband, father, amateur cyclist, and self-professed coffee aficionado. My passions include foster/adopt parenting and Nebraska football.",

    "description": "Your job isn’t 100% code, so improving skills like how you learn, how to focus, and coping mechanisms need to be worked on just like learning a new framework. Everyone has struggles, whether it is accepting criticism, managing stress, or finding time for passion projects. But those don’t have to hold us back!  We'll explore 4 techniques to help with these exact issues. Even if you never go to “soft skills” talks, these techniques can help you grow, improve and maybe stick with a new habit for once.",
    "notes": "This talk will be a look at how different psychological techniques that can help optimize our brains in both our professional and personal lives. There is a lot of interaction that can be found from studying and incorporating mindfulness, a growth mindset (believing that all things can be learned or improved through work and effort) and how building good habits sometimes require a retrospective (just like your sprints). Alway will do a quick dive into speed reading, and how even if you are a fast reader there is always room for improvement (and will help you in the long run with optimizing all that other learning you are doing).\r\n\r\nAs a mother, I am always trying to optimize my time.  I have less time for continual learning, but it is so important in our field to stay up to date on new technology or brush up on design patterns. I certainly can't make more hours in a day, but through my own trial and error I have tried a lot of techniques to make my time and thoughts smarter. I am a chronic time management processes junkie, who loves diving into psychology books to understand why the brain behaves the way it does sometimes. Some of my favorite subjects are diving into stress management, brain development, and explore effects meditation has on the brain. All of this experience is from my 13 years of software engineering (where I thought I needed time management help) and my 4 years being a mother (the true and ultimate test of time management).",

    "description": "In the contemporary world of learning algorithms - “data is the new oil”. Data demands efficient refinement to expose valuable information. To lay a strong foundation for the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to work their magic,  the crude oil-like data needs to be infused with domain knowledge and extracted into \"features\". This talk aims to introduce the audience to the subject of Feature Engineering, and talk about the power of the most creative aspect of data science which often does not get its due limelight. \r\n\r\nIt will also walk the audience through the process of feature engineering as done in formal settings with a simple hands-on Pythonic example on publicly available data, along with putting forward some popular techniques like hashing, encoding, and embedding,  which assists in pulling the most out of the data after giving it a proper structure for predictive modeling. Terms pertaining to the realm of feature engineering like relevance, selection, combination, and explosion  will also be discussed. The goal is to institute the importance of data, especially in its worthy format, and the spell it casts on fabricating smart learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n# Outline\r\n\r\n## Introduction (2-3 minutes)\r\n- Rise of Machine Learning \u0026 Applications: Reason for its bloom \u0026 dominance\r\n- Reflecting on the core differences between crude data and features\r\n\r\n## Feature Engineering (10 minutes)\r\n- Laying down the basics with what, why, where: Definition, Importance, Usages\r\n- Step-by-step formal process of manual Feature Engineering: Iterative cycle of Brainstorming, Creating \u0026 Testing\r\n- Popular techniques for feature identification, representation and selection: correlation, categorizing, binning, hashing, encoding, embedding, etc.\r\n\r\n## Hands-On Example (Audience-level and Time-constraint dependent) (10 minutes)\r\n- Live Python example implemented via Jupyter Notebook [code to be made publicly available]\r\n- Polishing a dataset to form features on the spot\r\n\r\n## More about Feature Engineering (5-8 minutes)\r\n- Allied terms common in the realm: Feature Selection, Feature Combination, Feature Relevance\r\n- How much is too much?

    "abstract": "Being a good developer isn't just about slinging code; we're part of a community. Interacting with others in a community means feelings are involved. \n\nIn this talk you’ll learn how emotions are affecting you by modeling them as an API and looking at the code.",
    "description": "Imagine that your brain is wired to an API, and that one of the endpoints triggers you to be absolutely furious when it’s called. All the other emotions have endpoints as well. This is the metaphor that I use to describe how feelings work.\r\n\r\nWhen we think about emotions this way, they become a bit less scary. The metaphor allows us to use technical language to describe experiences which are often misunderstood. \r\n\r\nTo explain why it's important to improve our emotional responses I go over research which describes how improperly handling your emotions can have significant impacts things like abstract thinking, short-term memory and executive function. \r\n\r\nThen I present a toolbox full of techniques that you can use develop emotional fluency, and I illustrate a number of those techniques by describing my own emotional challenges as if they were written in code. I describe how I used those skills to “refactor” that code.\r\n\r\nThis topic is particularly relevant today, as the non-coding aspects of developer life are becoming more important than the coding ones. Thriving in a diverse community requires us to develop our skills in communication, understanding and empathy. I want to share what I've learned about emotions in a way developers can relate to, so they can grasp how feelings impact not only their own quality of work, but their ability to work well with others.",
    "notes": "If you read my bio, you'll see that I am in a unique position to make ill-defined and imprecise feelings understandable to a technical audience. I've spent years developing the emotional API idea, and as I've done so I've found more and more research that points to specific measurable impacts on our lives as developers. This has helped me frame the benefits of this emotional work clearly.",

When you have libraries that contain propitiatory code, or are just for your organizations internal use only, you don't want to expose those libraries to the open marketplace.

During this session, we'll discuss some of the reasons why package managers are a good idea, and we'll demonstrate how to create a private repository in Azure DevOps for your organization, and show how to publish to and consume that repository.",

For over 50 years Moore’s Law has described persistent exponential growth in computational power, but physical limitations have slowed that trend.

But what about JavaScript?\r\n\r\nThankfully, new paradigms handle parallelism over the web. Web Worker constructs allow long-running code to execute in the background without blocking the UI. Shared Memory and Atomic operations allow true sharing of data among worker processes.

While the topic is somewhat advanced, we certainly have all experienced sites that stop responding, with little or no explanation. In situations where heavy client-side mathematical calculation or other long-running processing is required, utilizing Web Workers efficiently can make a huge difference.\r\n\r\nAtomics were temporarily disabled in 2018 due to concerns surrounding Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities, but the Chrome team took steps that it felt addressed the problem, and other browsers have begun to follow suit.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this talk will be to introduce relevant features—some of which have been introduced as recently as ES2017—and to help attendees determine when leveraging \"multithreaded\" JavaScript may be worth the development time and overhead.",

Some common questions I hear when talking to others are: What are they? How do you use them? Do they replace life-cycle methods and/or class components completely? We will go over all of these together. I'll start with a basic React app using a few stateful, class components using life-cycle methods, custom methods and API interaction. I will then convert the components over to functional ones while integrating several different hooks, without losing any functionality. Finally, we will look into some common \"gotchas\" that may be confusing for people starting out with hooks. You will come away from this talk with a good foundation for various primitive hooks in React, and you'll understand how they're used and how you can start to write your own custom hooks.",

    "title": "What I Learned About Software Development from Origami",
    "abstract": "At first glance origami and software development appear to have very little in common. Is there anything that can be learned by comparing the two?\n\nIn this session we’ll talk about some of the things about software development that can be learned from origami. And we'll fold some origami together!",
    "description": "Origami is the art of paper folding. Software development is the process of putting together instructions for a computer in order to get the computer to perform some desired operation. At first glance origami and software development appear to have very little in common. One is very physical in nature. The other is almost completely digital. Is there anything that can be learned by comparing the two?\r\n\r\nIn this session we’ll talk about some of the parallels we can draw between origami and software development and some of the things about software development that can be learned from origami. This presentation is from a technical perspective, but anyone involved in the software development process can benefit. If you’re a fan of origami in the shape of unicorns, dragons, dinosaurs or popular Star Wars characters you should probably attend this session. Origami paper will be provided, and no previous origami experience is required.",
    "notes": "This is a presentation on software craftsmanship, disguised as a presentation about software development and origami. Origami and software development are obviously very different, but at least one very strong parallel exists between them: what work we do is important, but also how we do it.\r\n\r\nThere is no code in this presentation (my preferred type of presentation usually involves some form of live coding), but the parallels between software development and origami come from a very technical perspective. This presentation has TONs of pictures of origami (all models folded by me and pictures taken by me). I also have attendees fold an origami model interactively as part of the presentation. It's a fun presentation that's lighter than some more technical talks, but also provides some deep thoughts for attendees to ponder.\r\n\r\nI have given this presentation at Agile 2019, OpenWest 2019 and Utah Big Mountain Data \u0026 Dev. It seemed to be very well received every time I've given it.",

    "description": "Showing up to an interview is only one small component of a successful interview. This talk will show you how to plan your research study, establish goals, create your discussion guide, determine the best questions to ask to gather the right information, establish rapport with your participant, and execute the interview. Creating templates for different types of interviews and users can help streamline your process and set you up for success. I will give you tips on a few crucial interview techniques and best practices like how to stay grounded as the apprentice and bring participants out of the weeds and back on track. With a little preparation and planning in advance, your user interview can be used to gather critical information for better designs. \r\n\r\nOutline\r\n●\tWhat is the user interview method?\r\n●\tWhy is it fabulous?\r\n●\tWhen it might not work\r\n●\tTypes of formats/scenarios/environments\r\n●\tHow to prepare for user interviews\r\n●\tBeing aware of cognitive biases\r\n●\tWriting the discussion guide: content, components and formats\r\n●\tConducting interviews in person\r\n●\tConducting interviews via video or phone\r\n●\tTechniques and tips on how to:\r\no\tBuild the rapport\r\no\tKeep them in line\r\no\tGet out of the weeds\r\no\tGive participants confidence and feel comfortable\r\no\tNote-taking and research study preparation\r\no\tDebriefing with note-takers\r\no\tAdditional information to capture\r\n",

Through the struggles and lessons I have learned along the way, I have developed a set of best practices. I now share this wisdom with members of my team and will share it with attendees of the conference. \r\n\r\nAs a lead UX Designer with extensive researcher chops, I can easily translate research practices so that a technologist can understand the value of this method. My hope is to help those who are in a jam by teaching them how to conduct interviews and research properly. Having great interview skills is key to successful research that leads to valuable insights. This can help any person build empathy for the user, and create better designs, based on a solid foundation of research, not guesses. ",

The take away is to combat the behaviors and help everyone prevent biases from creeping in to their design work and that of others around you.",
    "description": "Generally, people go into tests with good intentions of gathering accurate, pristine information, so how does all this bias creep in? It’s pretty common to have several psychological biases working against you that can cloud your design and user research. This talk will focus on surfacing some of the darkest types of bias and how to prevent and combat them. Also, learn how to use some of those cognitive biases for good in your designs. No dark patterns here folks.\r\n\r\nOutline\r\n●\tOpening hook story\r\n●\tAgenda\r\no\tWhat is cognitive bias?\r\no\tWhat are the signs?\r\no\tHow do you fight it?\r\no\tHow do we use it to our advantage?\r\n●\tDefine\r\n●\tWhy it matters\r\n●\tTypes of bias\r\no\tSelf/You\r\n▪\tBlind spot bias\r\n▪\tExperimenter’s bias\r\n▪\tObserver-expectancy effect\r\no\tSelf vs others\r\n▪\tSocial comparison bias\r\no\tAligning with me/my beliefs\r\n▪\tSemmelweis effect\r\n▪\tNot Invented Here bias\r\no\tCreating relationships/togetherness/on others\r\n▪\tCourtesy bias/Bandwagon effect/Group Think\r\no\tRecent/long ago\r\n▪\tBaader-Meinhoff\r\n▪\tPeak-end rule\r\n●\tUse in your design for good\r\no\tBaader-Meinhoff\r\no\tIkea\r\no\tHumor effect\r\no\tBizarreness effect\r\no\tDefault effect\r\n●\tIt’s a wrap – summary of talk and take-aways\r\n",

This will increase their awareness of cognitive biases, help them to understand how to apply them in positive ways in their design work and give them tangible ways to apply the concepts that they learn. It will also help them in future research efforts to prevent “leading the witness” and conduct or observe bias-free research studies.\r\n\r\nAs a user researcher and designer, I have seen first-hand how these biases can creep in to design and research. I have seen designers bias participants by their reactions (observer-expectancy bias). I have seen how I have loaded questions with my own personal (blind spot) bias. By talking about real-world and personal examples, I can help others understand how we all have biases and what we can do, as designers and technologists, to prevent them from making their way in to our projects.\r\n\r\nI gave this talk to attendees of Big Design in Dallas in September, 2019.

    "description": "Enterprise software is often terrible. Through UX research methods, we have the chance to improve it. In this talk, I show how to apply mixed methods to inform UX design on software and services that are not consumer-facing, rather used internally by companies and employees. I will talk about how to take research to new heights, by modifying the traditional Service Design Blueprint, to suite alternative research needs and how this can make any project infinitely better.\r\n\r\nMany of us have worked on some pretty poorly designed enterprise software. As UX professionals, we must fight for those who suffer through that experience for hours on end at work. I am going to share a case study where I applied user research methods and Service Design principles to improve the report-making process. My quest for a better customer report goes through a variety of research methods to uncover gaps and opportunities. Going from low-fidelity analysis to improvement recommendations, I show people how they can think outside of the box of a traditional Service Design Blueprint to make any project profoundly better. Using mixed methods in creative ways can be applied to projects outside of the consumer-facing UX world. \r\n\r\nOutline\r\n●\tDefinition/overview of Enterprise software\r\n●\tDefinition/overview of Service Design\r\n●\tDiscuss problem to be solved: Reports for Customers\r\n●\tResearch plan of attack\r\no\tDiscuss the mixed research methods used to break down problem, surface opportunities and make recommendations for improvements\r\n●\tDeeper discussion of how Service Design Blueprint was applied to this process/journey\r\n●\tMoving Service Design Blueprint from low res to high res/digital deliverable\r\n●\tRecommendations and next steps\r\n●\tBenefits of Service Design Blueprint and research process\r\n●\tProject wins and benefits\r\n●\tExplain how these methods can work for you",
    "notes": "Internal enterprise systems and software are often easy opportunities for improvement (what we call ‘low hanging fruit’). I want attendees to be aware of just how rewarding this career opportunity can be. Also, attendees will learn how the foundations of a Service Design Blueprint and other mixed research methods, can be applied to improve the customer or employee experience. By creatively adjusting a traditional research framework, I will show the audience how making a few adjustments to the traditional swim lanes, they can make powerful Service Design Blueprints that are specifically catered to the problem they are trying to solve. \r\n\r\nI have several years of experience working on Enterprise software, ranging from working on software and apps for animal hospitals, financial companies, security companies and more. I understand the dire state of these systems and the need for upgrading. Plus, I have experience in mapping out a company’s system or process by using methods like a Service Design Blueprint. This method is greatly organic, and I want attendees to take away this broadened perspective so that they can apply this modified Service Design Blueprint to their projects. \r\n",

    "description": "Redux is one of the go-to tools for managing state in React applications. Frequently we depend on asynchronous behavior like fetching data from an API to update state. Unfortunately, out of the box, Redux can only handle synchronous state changes. The Redux-Thunk package provides the missing link needed to dispatch functions as actions so you can involve asynchronous effects in state changes. We will briefly review the standard actions provided by Redux. Then we will move on to understand how Thunks let us build action flows with promise based asynchronous calls. Finally, we will apply the concepts to create a React app using Thunks to manage loading and displaying data from an external API with loading spinners and error-handling.\r\n",

It doesn't matter where you start; it's about where you end up.  Using pop culture references, we'll discuss the journey I took to get from Customer Service Rep where my understanding of IT was a couple people in a closet like office to working as a QA in a waterfall software shop for a university to Automation Test Engineer and Lead QA.  I want to share my experience with others to show that we've all traveled down different roads but our experiences and knowledge shape how and what we test as we're testing, from how we interact with a mobile app to how we test that new website to how we write up a bug ticket.  Everything we’ve done before comes with us into testing, and it’s what shapes us to do what we do best! ",

And with the deployment, the endless tweaking to actually get everything running in a production environment. If only there was a way to test everything in that environment first… This is where containers will come in to save the day. With container, you not only run your code in an environment similar to the production server, it is the production environment. In this talk, the attendees will learn about how to create container friendly applications, how to use containers to share their code with their team and finally, how to use those same containers to deploy to a production server with very little efforts. \r\n",

But RxJS is efficient and expressive! We declare relationships between entities, describing the what not the how. The basic sequence operators, map, filter, and reduce, are probably familiar from using them in array chains. RxJS is a core part of the Angular framework used in everything from Reactive Forms to the HTTP module. Harnessing observables with Angular’s async pipe is essential to building clean and concise components. Developers can overcome the RxJS learning curve by focussing on core concepts like hot vs cold observables, piping operations, and a few of the most common operators.",

Ash will share with you the design techniques used to create effective user interfaces through sketching, mind stretching, and iteration.  Further, you'll learn how to conduct black hat sessions to shake out missed requirements, mismatched UI expectations, and get much needed buy in from project stakeholders.\r\n\r\nWith a world that wants everything faster and faster, Ash will give you simple techniques that make a big difference; thus enabling you to think through multiple solutions, get yourself un-stuck from a single idea, iterate on your designs, and rally your team around this process. \r\n\r\nReady, get set, FAIL!.. The faster you fail, the faster you can succeed.",

Black hats are the single most important tool I use to get a project team's buy in. ",

    "abstract": "There’s a wealth of talent in your (company’s) own backyard: people eager to learn new skills, advance their career \u0026 create products your users love. We perfected our apprenticeship model to scale growth \u0026 development at Hudl; I share the promise it holds for companies across the Midwest.",
    "description": "Successfully developing and retaining skilled engineers, designers, and product people is make-or-break for companies large and small. Hudl has grown fast and done well in that arena: today over 250 development team members ply their trade at the company, building video and analysis tools for sports teams around the world.\r\n \r\nOne key to Hudl's success is apprenticeships, where anyone in the company can apprentice in a new role. The apprenticeship program has evolved over many years to become an adaptable, decentralized, and finely-tuned framework. We found that apprenticeships not only drive employee career growth; they also build a more robust and diverse workforce as a whole. This model is part of the big picture of talent pipelines in the Midwest and beyond, where making smart investments in human capital means we’re tapping into “diamonds in our own backyard.”\r\n \r\nThis talk shows the How, the Who, and the Why of Hudl’s apprenticeship program, told via individual narratives and product team outcomes.",
    "notes": "I've been at Hudl for two years now and have mentored, managed, hired, declined, observed, and worked side-by-side with numerous graduates (and rejects). \r\n\r\nThis talk is personal, sharing direct quotes in the voice of the individuals who have gone through the Apprenticeship framework. Their stories add a spark of color and interest to the talk.\r\nThis talk is also frank \u0026 skeptical. I talk about the costs, the drawbacks, the failures. I calculate the time value of money and the long-term career implications for salary leveling due to the Apprenticeship program. I share the particular aspects that make it work, and the aspects that had to be changed over time. I talk about where half-measures do not work.\r\n\r\nMy own unconventional path in tech gives me a special passion for this topic. Going from part-time Business Analyst and Quality Assurance Analyst to Scrum Master, I have thought a lot about how individuals grow and seek new opportunities.\r\n \r\nI would like to see this model catch fire and become widespread in the Midwest where we are poised to really take advantage of this unconventional talent pipeline. Hudl has used the Apprenticeship model for years now with great success. Some of our most talented Senior QAs, (Technical) Product Managers, Data Analysts, Scrum Masters, and engineers followed this path. Many of them started from unconventional departments such as Customer Support and Marketing. Both the need for personal transformation and for a company to transform itself over time, this topic is valuable. I think this fits the intent of Connectaha, and I’m really excited to bring this information to the Greater Omaha area. ",

    "notes": "I'm the Head of Developer Relations at Auht0, an IDaaS company that provides an IAM solution. One of my missions is to make identity easier to understand for developers who have a job to do (that isn't auth) so they can be informed, but not overwhelmed or bogged down by the topic of auth and the daunting prospect of authenticating users and authorizing APIs.\r\n\r\nThis is a new talk for 2020 wherein I will demystify OAuth 2.0 and OIDC (people VERY frequently get these mixed up or misunderstand them), but in an approachable and actionable way for developers who need to Get The Job Done. Auth is needed by everyone, and can be a very daunting and scary subject for engineering teams. I'll talk about the standards that everyone throws around (often doing so without understanding what they refer to), and share why it's OKAY to not know everything. Identity is complex, but in order to be successful, you don't need to know exactly how to draw the rest of the $%\u0026$ owl. I'll discuss what devs need to know to get started and to not feel overwhelmed by the complexity of modern identity.\r\n\r\nMy authentication talks are historically extremely successful at conferences. Auth is something most developers need, and most also don't understand it all that well. Most of my auth talks in 2019 were standing room only with people sitting along the walls and on the floor.

    "abstract": "When we write code, we value correctness, clarity, and economy, and we acknowledge that we are performing a logical and creative act. When we write poetry, we also value clarity, economy, and achieving our stated impact. The ways we give feedback on code and poetry have more in common than we think.",
    "description": "Writing code is a logical and analytical activity, but is also a creative activity. Developers have their own voices and styles (and quirks!). The code we write exists as an artifact of text, but it also must run in the world and be experienced by others. Not only must our code work, but it most communicate intent, achieve the desired effects, and be approachable from the outside. What exists in the programmer's brain implicitly must become explicit, and assumptions must be clarified.\r\n\r\nThis is not dissimilar from poetry.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we explore code reviews (and more broadly, feedback on code) through the lens of teaching creative writing and performance. What practices from the classroom can we bring over to our code reviews, and what opportunities do they afford us? How do we honor the voices of our developers? \r\n\r\nWe will discuss building a shared language, naming the heart, creating opportunities for experimentation, building shared values, and fostering emotional safety.\r\n\r\nWe will also discuss language-specific tooling that we can use to take care of the easy stuff.",
    "notes": "Before becoming a software developer, I taught middle and high school language arts. Later, I taught teachers how to teach poetry and creative writing.\r\n\r\nAs I've been in different organizations as a software developer, it seems to me that a few things are true:\r\n\r\n1. The way feedback is given on code varies widely between and within organizations\r\n2. Code review and feedback vary widely in effectiveness, based both on the quality of feedback itself and the level of trust\r\n3. Work is more satisfying when trust and collaboration exist\r\n\r\nMoreover, practices we use as teachers to give feedback on work can translate directly to teams of software engineers giving feedback on work, and can translate in a relatively egalitarian way.\r\n\r\nThis talk, then, is for developers (of any level) and folks who work with developers and interact with software-in-progress. Some actual code examples will be shown (as illustrative examples), but no proficiency in the various languages is needed.",

    "abstract": "As developers, we want to do more and improve our productivity in and out of work. But at the same time we neglect our body, which is key to a better mind and our overall well-being. Let's debunk myths around food and exercise and learn what we really need to do to start becoming our best selves.",
    "description": "As developers, we have a tendency to try to do more, in and out of the office: stay more focused, deliver better code, learn more things, work on more side projects. This not only leads to frustration and burnout sometimes, but can also make us push basic good habits aside and neglect our bodies; something that a lot of programmers tend to do anyway. But how do we find the time and energy for all that if we're already busy and tired? Can we really be more productive and improve our well-being at the same time? In this talk we'll take a look at the basic pillars for a better body and mind: diet, movement and rest. We'll debunk some long-standing myths, learn the actual facts and provide actionable tips along the way, so you can finally start becoming the best version of yourself.",
    "notes": "# Tentative outline\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\n- We deem our mind important but sometimes neglect our body. This is a huge mistake since body and mind are completely interdependent.\r\n- Diet, movement and rest have a deep impact on mental health, mood, stress levels, ability to concentrate and think more clearly.\r\n- Moving more actually gives us more energy. It's a counterintuitive virtuous circle.\r\n- We can be more productive in our professional and personal lives. Achieving more is not about putting more time in, but using it better (better quality, less quantity).\r\n\r\n## Eat\r\n\r\n- The old food pyramid has been proven wrong.\r\n  - However the food industry keeps pushing it (low fat products).\r\n  - A better eating guide: Harvard's Healthy Eating Plate (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/)\r\n  - Having a \"varied diet\" doesn't mean eating everything. Flat out ignore most of what you find in the supermarket (processed foods).\r\n- Calories are hard to track and a terrible measure of healthiness anyway.\r\n  - Metabolic impact of food changes depending on the matrix (eg, free sugars vs sugar mixed with fiber in fruit).\r\n  - Comparisons based on calories are absurd: diet coke has zero calories, nuts have a lot.\r\n  - Focus on ingredients and amount of processing.\r\n  - Non-processed foods fill you up way more. It's difficult to go overboard with them, but very easy with processed foods.\r\n- Going the extra mile: reduce the feeding window\r\n  - Intermittent fasting\r\n  - Controlling your appetite: actual hunger vs wanting to eat\r\n\r\n## Move\r\n\r\n- Do not sit for long\r\n  - Pomodoro technique: work for 30-40 min, rest for 5 min\r\n  - Active rest: light movement during resting periods\r\n  - Try standing desks if possible\r\n- Lead an active life\r\n  - Every little things adds up, take every opportunity to move\r\n  - Climb up stairs, walk to places if they're not too far\r\n- Do regular training\r\n  - Consider high intensity interval training (HIIT) routines to start. Low barrier of entry: very short, can be done at home.\r\n  - Do not neglect strength training.

    "abstract": "Classes in JavaScript are problematic in a few important ways that many people are still not aware of, and they don't really have much advantages over alternative patterns based on just functions. Let's show the audience how to simplify their codebases by taking advantage of function composition!",
    "description": "More than three years later, the introduction of classes to the ECMAScript standard is still a controversial topic. Brought over from popular classical object-oriented languages, they've not only been argued an unnecessary feature for JavaScript, but their usage can become actually harmful very easily. In this talk we'll take a look at the potential issues and pitfalls of using classes, like the need for context binding of methods, and suggest alternative patterns that are conceptually simpler, easier to work with, safer to use, more idiomatic, require less code and are actually more powerful.",

Classes don't work like in other languages. Prototypes under the hood which are dynamic, not static.\r\n- Lack of features. No private members, static members, decorators... There are proposals but not part of the standard yet.\r\n- Context binding. Handling `this` is confusing and error prone in classes when async code is involved. Binding ties in with false expectations again, plus performance implications.\r\n- Harder to optimize. Classes don't minify very well and are generally harder to deal with for tools.\r\n- Broader disadvantages of inheritance model (vs composition)\r\n\r\n## Alternative patterns\r\n\r\n- Classic patterns based on prototypes (constructor functions or `Object.create`) share similar issues.\r\n- The alternative is to use simple functions. We can do things equivalent to OOP features typically implemented with classes: inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, plus design patterns like singletons.\r\n- Factory functions and modules provide instance creation with encapsulation via closures, without having to worry about `this`.\r\n- Static type checking as an extra to enforce additional constraints (interfaces). Structural vs nominal typing.\r\n\r\n## Recent case studies\r\n\r\n- Hooks API introduced into React that matches class componentes functionality\r\n- Class API proposal for Vue dropped in favor of composition functions\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\n- Adjust your expectations: classes in JavaScript do not work as in other languages\r\n- Watch out for issues with context and `this`: remember to bind methods when dealing with async code\r\n- Consider using functions: closures are powerful and feel natural to the language (valid reasons not to: specific performance scenarios with tons of instances, or framework forces you to use classes)\r\n\r\n# Speaking experience\r\n\r\n[https://speakerdex.co/soyguijarro](https://speakerdex.co/soyguijarro)",

    "abstract": "Writing Redux-like code with useReducer and the Context API actually makes you appreciate the architectural design and concepts behind Redux, which are definitely here to stay. This talk will happily embark on that exploration while ultimately questioning its real value beyond the educational side.",
    "description": "Redux is arguably the de-facto standard for global state management in the React ecosystem. Yet despite its huge popularity, it's often accused of being too cumbersome, requiring developers to write a lot of boilerplate code and constantly switch between many files. Tools like Redux Starter Kit aim to improve the situation, but some people still feel Redux is too much for their projects. However rolling our own state manager is out of the question. Or is it? In this talk we'll see how to take advantage of the new useReducer hook and the official Context API to build custom Redux-like solutions, so we can simplify it in whatever ways we want or take different approaches that better suit our project. The experience will actually help us understand Redux better and appreciate the good things about it.",

Your mental health is arguably the single most important factor in your ability to perform well, avoid burnout, and build resiliency, but we shroud the topic in secrecy, stigma, and co-opted clinical language that makes us think we know what's going on. We often don't even speak of what we feel to family and friends until we're facing a crisis.\r\n\r\nWe need to change all of that. You don't have to stay in the dark, and you *don't* have to suffer alone. In this talk we’ll start with some basics about mental health, then cover the most common mental health challenges facing developers, and then learn about some techniques to supercharge your brain by improving your mental hygiene (whether you have a psychological disorder or not). Most importantly, you’ll learn how to have a conversation with your coworkers (and other people in your life) about supporting each other and finding your best selves.",
