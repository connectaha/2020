If you are not thinking about accessibility, then you’re not thinking about the full user experience. Ideally, the user experience for everyone should be the same regardless of physical or cognitive limitations. This means addressing user accessibility scenarios from the onset. Accessibility makes it possible for people with disabilities to understand and navigate well designed digital products. However, accessibility is often one of the last things addressed in product and software design. These guidelines will cover some of the major factors to address and test for in order to meet the accessibility standards in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

Yet, most applications I worked on heavily relied on user interfaces and an otherwise object-oriented architecture, so the decision to move to F# or some other functional programming language didn't make sense. \r\n\r\nDespite this, many principles and patterns from functional programming DID make sense to implement for cleaner and more robust code. Important paradigms like immutability, method chaining, and using expressions over statements were certainly things even C# developers could take advantage of! In this talk, I want to demonstrate how C# developers can implement these beneficial patterns and principles and explore how doing so ultimately results in better code!\r\n\r\n","organization":"Self-Employed","photo":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/38211/atacke-headshot-md.jpg"},{"id":"jeremy-wagner","firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Wagner","bio":"Jeremy Wagner is a web performance consultant at SiteImprove in Minnesota who writes and speakers frequently on the web and how to make it faster for everyone, everywhere.","title":"Make it Boring","description":"A good case can be made for why boring is preferable to exciting in many aspects of our lives. Yet, we're reluctant to apply this sentiment to the web. Rather, we're in a relentless pursuit of the exciting in this increasingly JavaScript-centric world of web development. A pursuit that, despite our best efforts, litters the landscape of the web with excruciatingly slow and inaccessible pages. As division brews over the roles of HTML, CSS, and indeed JavaScript itself, we need to ask if it's worth making the web boring again.\r\n\r\nBut why make the web more boring? Because boring is fast, resilient, fault tolerant, and accessible. Boring is the essence of unobtrusive designs that facilitate interactions rather than hinder them. When we rely wholesale on JavaScript to build for the web, we're inevitably reinventing things—things that can hinder or even fail people in unexpected ways despite our best intentions. In this session, you'll learn why building for the web with a greater emphasis on core technologies is far from boring, but truly rewarding and exciting work that makes the web more inclusive.","organization":"","photo":"https://papercallio-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/avatar/5977/jlwagner.jpg"},{"id":"hilary-stohs-krause","firstName":"Hilary","lastName":"Stohs-Krause","bio":"Hilary Stohs-Krause is a full-stack software developer at [Ten Forward Consulting](http://tenforward.consulting) in Madison, WI.

Leveraging dependency injection and IoC makes it a breeze to build solutions that are modular and testable, but building out those dependency chains in our unit tests can leave them cluttered and overly complex. It's time to learn to embrace the magic of IoC, DI, and mocking to lower the friction of writing and maintaining unit tests. Taking cues from the open-source library Ease, you can see how to tap into the life-cycle of unit testing frameworks and integrate it with an IoC container to give you a fresh start for each test. Throw in a little mocking and a flexible pattern for managing setup and now you are testing in high gear! A great side-effect of using Ease, or a similar methodology, is that tests become more resilient against changes in the dependencies that are not a direct concern of the test, so you end up breaking fewer tests and changing less test code. What are you waiting for? Stop the ceremony, and start testing!","organization":"Alien Arc Technologies, LLC","photo":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/993158fc3d5564fab480c586ffe67d27?s=500"},{"id":"amanda-perkins","firstName":"Amanda","lastName":"Perkins","bio":"I've been a QA for 7 years now and I try to use my varied job skills to help improve not only software quality but the quality of interactions with my team.
